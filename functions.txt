-single input > goes on stack. operation > tries to pop stack. if only one element> stack underflow. keeps element on
stack. next time you do a number then operation, it uses the initial input. E.g.:
10 
+ 
Stack Underflow.
10
+ 
= 
20

- 'd' peeks the stack
- '=' peeks last element

- 'r' does the operation r+ where r is a 'random' number from a pre generated list https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8049556/what-s-the-difference-between-srand1-and-srand0

- infix is parsed and added then treated like normal RPN

-  2+4/3*6 = 2+(4/3)*6` = (2+(4/3))*6 = 20
-  2+2^2*2 = 2+(2^2)*2 = (2+(2^2))*2 = 12

- precedence of operations (H to L) : %,^,/,*,+,-
- if * and / and +/- are in one operation, it breaks this rule and does +- before *
- 3+3/1*5 = 30 > (3+3/1)*5
- 3+3*1/5 = 3 > 3+(3*1/5)

- always rounds down
